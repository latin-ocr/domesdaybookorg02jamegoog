For the execution os the Smwey‚ Commissioners called King’s

these Oommhsionern, or to quote from tir H. Ellis, p. 21:-

“ The InquisitorS‚ it appears, upon the ouths of the Sheriffs, the Lords of each Menon
the Presbytero ol' every Chureh, the Reves ol every Hundred, the Bailiffs and six V illaus
ol every village, were to enquire into the name of the place, who held it iu the timo
of King Edward, who was the present possessor, how many hides in the Manor, how many
oanucates in demesne, how many homagers, how many villana, how many cotrarii, how
many servi, what free-men, how many tenants in soeage‚ what quantity ol' wood, how much
meadow and postme, what mills aud fich-ponda, how much added or taken away, what the
gross velue in Kiug Edward's time, what the present value, and how much each free-men
or such-man had or has. All this was to be triply estimated: first, as the estote was held

its vulpe stood at the formation of the Survey. The jurors were moreover to state whether
any advauce could be made in the value.”

“ The Commta, which is also to be interpreted the plough-land, was as much arable
as could be managed with oue plough and the beasts belonging thcrcto in ayeor3 having
rneadow, pastore, and houscs sor the house-holders aud cattle belonging to it ;” and it
appears that “ the hide was the measure of land in the Oorrfessor’s reign, the carucata that
to which it was reduced by the Conqueror’s new standard.”

The Hide is generally supposed to be equal to 120 acres.
