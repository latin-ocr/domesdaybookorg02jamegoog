It will be observed that a red line is run through the
names of places, and this is . also sometimes done to the names
of persons, and to paragraphs to which it is desired to direct
particular attention. This is peculiar to Domesday Book, and
is equivalent to the modern method of underlining a passage
for the same purpose.

The old letters in the title page have been copied from letters
in Domesday Book itsels.

The woodcuts represent the manner in which Domesday Book
was bound, and the chest in which it was formerly kept, these

have been copied by the Anastatic process froin a woodcut in the
Illustrated London News.

The Photographs were transferred to zinc by M'r. Appel‚ of the

In Sir Henry Ellis' Introduction to Domesday‚ an estimate
for publishing a fac-simile of the work in 1767 is given at page ‘

the work is estimated at five years. This estimate does not
include the cost of supervision, and therefore the work, if it had

plpen gggcbrggd, would certainly have cost the Government not less

The folio edition of 1783 was printed with types made expressly

printing-office in the mouth of February, 1808.” ’

The cost of this edition is said to have been stoebe, and the
cost of a copy of the work so great that very few persons could
afford to purchase one, but by the application of Photo-zincography
to copying and printing MSS, and by publishing the work in parts,
any one can now procure at a trifling cost, an exact fac-simile of the
