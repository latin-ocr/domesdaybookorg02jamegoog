“A.D. MLXXXV. In this year men declared, aud 101 south said, that Cnnt King
01 Denmark‚ 0011 01 Kiug Svein, was bound hitherward‚ and would 11111 this land with the
aid 01 ‚Rcbert Count 01 Flanders 3 because cnut had Rcbert's daughter to wife. When
William King of England, who was then residing in Narmandy,-because 110 0111101 both
Englaud 0111 Narmandy,-was apprizcd of this, he went into England with 00 large an
army 01 horsemen and 1001, from Frauce and 110111 1111110111,οε 110101 before had songht
this land, so that men wondered how this laud could seed all that army. But the king
caused the army 10 be distributed through all this land among his vassals: aud they fed the
army, each according to the measure 01 his land. And men had great affiictiou this year 3
aud the king caused the land about the sea 10110 laid waste, so that if his 1000 should land,
they might 1101 hare whereon they might 00 1001111 seiae. But when the king was 1111010101

in sooth that his foes were hindered‚ aud could 1101 further their expedition, he let some
Ι 011110 army go to 1110110110 laud: and some he held in this land 0101 the winter. Thea 01
midwinter the king was at Glaucester with his ‘witau’ and there held his court five days;
and afterwards the arclrbishop and clergy had a synod 1111001010. There was Maurice
chosen bishop 01 Laudas, and William 10 Νο110111, aud Rcbert 10 Chcshire. They 11010011
the king's clerks. After this the king had a great couucil, aud very deep speech with his
‘witan' about this land, how it was peopled, 01 by what men3 111011 sent his rnen aver all
England, into every 011110, 0111 caused 10 be ascertained 11011 many hundred hides were in
the shira, or what laud the king himself had, and cattle within the land, 01 what dues he
ought 10 have, 111 1110110 months, from thesbite. Also he caused to be written how much
land his archbishops had, and his suffragan 1110110110, and his abbots, and 1110 00110 ; and-
though Ι 11101 11011010 somewhat prolixly-what 01 how much each mau had who wasa
holder 01 land in England, iu 10111, 01 in cattle, and how much money it might be worth.
80 very 1101101111 he caused it tabe traced out, that there was 11010110 single 11110, nor one

· 1011 0110111110101011-111100110111010 1011, though it seemed 10 him 1100110110 1010-011 ·
